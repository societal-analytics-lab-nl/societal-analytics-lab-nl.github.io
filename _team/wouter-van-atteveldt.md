Wouter van Atteveldt â€“ Professor at the department of communication science. 


I am an interdisciplinary scientist by training, having received my M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and a joint Ph.D. in Artificial Intelligence and Communication Science from the VU Amsterdam. In the decade since being awarded a VENI grant on mediatized agenda setting, I have grown into a leading computational communication scientist, developing and using state of the art computational communication science techniques.
