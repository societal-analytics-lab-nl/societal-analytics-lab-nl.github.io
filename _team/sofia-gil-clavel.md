Hi! I am a Researcher, Research Engineer, and Lab Manager at the Societal Analytics Lab

Previously, I was a researcher at TU Delft working on the SC3 project.

I obtained my Ph.D. from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Germany, and the University of Groningen, Netherlands (link). Before, I studied actuarial science at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM), and I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science from the Mathematical Research Center of Mexico (CIMAT).
