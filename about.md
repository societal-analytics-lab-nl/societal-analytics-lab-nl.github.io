## Objectives

We aim to: 
 
* Expand VU research infrastructure

* Foster methodological innovation

* Increase Open Science through better reproducibility and transparency 

* Multiplicate interdisciplinary research teams


## Relevance

We want to foster research that fits the digital society that we live in, specifically targeting two groups of scholars:

* 1️⃣*Those New to the Matter* that are curious about how computational methods. We can benefit your research, we offer guidance, training, and essential tools to boost your career. Adding innovative computational elements to grants can often make them more competitive, and we’re happy to help you design, write, and execute research proposals.

* 2️⃣*Those Already in the Know*, i.e. those already familiar with computational methods, but that lack resources. We provide the necessary tools and infrastructure to facilitate your research project.


## What we do:

* Tools & Resources: From manual annotation to GPU-driven computing for text/image processing, we've got you covered!

* Learning & Collaboration: We promote knowledge exchange and foster global connections by offering talks, workshops, and hackatons.

* Grants and research proposals: We can help you foster your research proposal by adding computational methods. Talk to us for ideas and infrastructure support.
