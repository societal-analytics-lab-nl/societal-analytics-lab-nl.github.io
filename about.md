# Objectives


## Relevance

We want to foster research that fits the digital society that we live in, specifically targeting two groups of scholars:

* 1️⃣ Those New to the Matter: If you're curious about how computational methods can benefit your research, we offer guidance, training, and essential tools to boost your analytical career. Adding innovative computational elements to grants can often make them more competitive, and we’re happy to help you design, write, and execute research proposals.

* 2️⃣ Those Already in the Know: If you're already familiar with computational methods but lack resources, we provide the necessary tools and infrastructure to facilitate your research project.

## What we do:

* Data Collection: from social media footprints to other digital traces, we collect and archive them for easy access.

* Tools & Resources: whether it's software for manual annotation or GPU-driven computing for automatic text/image processing, we've got you covered.

* Learning & Collaboration: from training sessions to hackathons, we promote knowledge exchange and foster global connections.

* Grants and research proposals: if you are working on a research proposal and think that computational methods could benefit your design, talk to us for ideas and infrastructure support!
