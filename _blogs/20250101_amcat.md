# AmCAT: A searchable database for your text documents

Written by Sofia Gil-Clavel

So, you have been gathering a huge dataset consisting of continuously
retrieved social media posts. But now, you cannot analyse it in your
local computer because you do not have a large enough RAM. What should
you do?

One possible answer is to upload the data into a server and then perform
the analysis from there. But, now that you have done it, you realized
that you need and extra skill: “Big Textual Data Handling” … So, now
what?

Well, for both problems, there is one solution AmCAT (Amsterdam Content
Analysis Toolkit)!

AmCAT is a software designed to run in a computing server and to
facilitate big text data handling and analytics. AmCAT achieves both
goals by exploding the power of Elasticsearch and by building a Graphic
User Interface (GUI) that allows easy data exploration.

## How AmCAT works

![Figure 1: AmCAT-architecture.](\images\blog\amcat\amcat4 architecture.png)

As Figure 1 shows, AmCAT relies on Elasticsearch to store and handle the
data. Elasticsearch is an opened source software built to speed-up
handling and analysis of big unstructured data (Gormley & Tong, 2015).
Internally, in short, it works by inverse indexing any given JSON
object. A fundamental difference in Elasticsearch is that it is document
oriented, meaning that it stores entire objects or documents. It not
only stores them, but also indexes the contents of each document in
order to make them searchable. In Elasticsearch, you index, search,
sort, and filter documents —not rows of columnar data. This is a
fundamentally different way of thinking about data and is one of the
reasons Elasticsearch (therefore, AmCAT) can perform complex full-text
search in seconds.

AmCAT can be accessed through different ways. If you are comfortable
using Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), then you can access
AmCAT through the Amcat4 API. You can also access the AmCAT API through
R and Python. More information on how to access them is in section 2 of
the AmCAT [book](https://amcat.nl/book/02._getting-started). If you are
more comfortable using Graphic User Interfaces (GUIs), then Amcat4
Client is for you. You can check an example of it following this
[link](https://amcat4.labs.vu.nl/) (Figure 2).

## AmCAT quick overview through the Graphic User Interface

AmCAT goal is to facilitate and speed-up big textual analytics. It does
so by easing access to all Elasticsearch functionalities. In this
section, we give a quick overview of some of the things that AmCAT can
do. In the examples, we will focus on the GUI, but all can be translated
to the API.

As Figure 2 shows, there are already some big textual databases
preloaded to this server: Deventer (news site), den\_hag, and Dutch
News. Each of them can now be accessed through the AmCAT GUI. These
databases can now be searched, analysed, and visualized using AmCAT. For
example, if we choose the Dutch News database, then we will see
something like Figure 3.

&lt;Figure 3 about here: Summary of the Dutch News using AmCAT.&gt;

The *Summary* option gives us access to some basic information of the
data. For example, there are 2,370,705 articles in the database. The
collection goes from January 1st, 2008, to October 1st, 2024. The Dutch
journals that are considered are: The Telegraaf, Algemeen Dagblad, De
Volskrant, etc. We can also access the articles’ metadata by clicking on
them (Figure 4).

&lt;Figure 4 about here: AmCAT metadata example.&gt;

Elasticsearch (therefore, AmCAT) main feature is the speed at which
searches are done: super fast! This can be tested by looking for some
words or phrases using the “look for” section (Figure 5). Figure 5 shows
the articles that mentioned “kerstman” (Santa Claus in Dutch).
Similar to Figure 4, the AmCAT also returns a basic summary of the
result.

&lt;Figure 5 about here: Result from the search for the word
“kerstman”.&gt;

The *Aggregate* option (Figure 6) allows users to analyse and visualize
the data in an interactive manner. The GUI gives access to the following
visualizations: Line Graph, Bar Chart, List, and Table. In terms of
analyses, it only allows to count/aggregate the values, which is already
useful to get a quick understanding of the data!

News database.&gt;
