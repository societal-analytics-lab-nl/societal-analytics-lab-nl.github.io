At the societal analytics lab we aim to serve as a nexus for connecting various relevant skills in the area of computational analysis. If you find yourself in need of an expert opinion or support on a particular topic, please let us know. If you are a lab member and find yourself in possession of a set of skills that you believe could benefit others, please let us know.

We maintain a repository with R course material, on topics ranging from data wrangling to text analysis and advanced statistics. Feel free to use this material as you please, and to contact us for any questions or requests.
