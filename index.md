# The Societal Analytics Lab

Hey there! Welcome aboard the Societal Analytics Lab at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. Here the world of social behavior meets computational techniques. As we find ourselves in an increasingly digital society, the way we study social dynamics is shifting. No longer are we solely reliant on traditional methods; instead, we dive into the intriguing digital imprints left by everyday activities - from the casual tweet to the tracking of health and commercial behaviors.
